==============================

Example programs will serve as input to automated tests, as well as for 
demos and as food for thought when designing tranformations.

General
-------

We need a range of sizes of programs from trivial 5-10 line programs 
that use only a very limited range of language features up to "medium 
size" programs of about 100-300 lines which use a greater propertion
of the language. Programs should be written in a clear style, but there
is no coding standard (but programs could be styled after the Inferno
code in the ../code/*/ directories). Small programs may contain completely
arbitrary code, wheras larger ones should attempt to implement some kind 
of algorithm or meaningful function.

Language features
-----------------

Example programs must be legal C++. However, many language features
will not be supported for some time in Inferno. I would suggest that the 
most basic 75% of C and the most basic 25% of C++ would be about right. 
In particular, templates, exceptions and operator overloading should be 
avoided, at least for now (but classes, inheritance and new/delete are OK). 
There is no need to be systematic about language features because the 
Clang test suite does this - we need more typical code to excercise the 
Inferno transformations, which relate more to programming styles, constructs 
and patterns than language elements (but to prescribe specific constructs
would encourage common-mode blind spots).

Smaller test programs should use a smaller subset of the language.

Example programs should be self-contained and not #include any other 
files, including library files. No kernel or C-library calls should be 
made.

Constructs that result in undefined behaviour should be avoided as should 
compiler-specific extensions. Example programs should ideally compile
on GCC and Visual C++ but successful compilation on any well known
and up-to-date compiler is OK. Programs should not generate warnings
under the default compiler settings.

Note: present input programs are being compiled using: g++ -ansi
where gcc is version 3.4.4 or thereabouts.

Test harness compatibility
--------------------------

Example programs should return an unsigned char result eg

unsigned char main()
{
    unsigned char c;
    ...
    return c;
}

The result should be arbitrary byte value, preferably not 0 or 1 (these
results could obtain too easily from a corrupted program). Note that the
test harness will compile and run the program directly in order to obtain
the expected return value - there is therefore no need to specify this
value in any way and it would be better not to (so the program can be 
modified by hand without needing to update the comment).

Programs should avoid uninitialised variables and other causes of 
indeterminacy, but if this becomes a problem I'll automate some kind of 
checker, so don't worry about this too much. In general, there is *no
need* to prove the expected result - the example programs themselves are
not under test.

Programs should ignore input arguemnts and not interact over stdin/out/err.

License
-------

Inferno is subject to a BSD-style license, and submitted test programs
must be submitted under this license. I'd be more comfortable if programs
were completely original - if existing suitable resources exist, under
a compatible license, please let me know.

Submitted (and accepted) programs will be available on the public internet
via Sourceforge.

Getting programs to me
----------------------

Email is fine (jgraley@bigfoot.com) and please include a comment to
the effect that you agree to licese the code to Inferno. Alternatively, 
I can grant you checkin powers in the Inferno-synth Sourceforge project. 
Example input programs go in inferno-synth/trunk/test/examples and 
there will be some kind of filelist file (TBD)

I cannot guarantee to use all submissions (but I can't see why I wouldn't).
