		Abnormal Contexts:
		------------------

	NotMatchAgent
	MatchAnyAgent

(non-local links)
And-rule does not apply (evaluator context)
Permitted non-match means maybe cannot key

	SearchContainerAgent (recurse restriction)		
	StarAgent (pattern restriction)

(local links)
Reuse of agent confuses conjecture (multiuse context)	
Note: StarAgent only needs links for pattern restriction, not 
pre-restriction

		Local links:
		------------

	StandardAgent (subcontainers)
	StarAgent (pattern restriction)
	
Subcontainer is constructed - even though it could be pointers...?	
 - TODO maybe merge star algo back in to SA (maybe absorb stars into 
   SAs in a pre-pass).
	
	SearchContainerAgent (recurse restriction)
	
Comes from Walk_iterator::GetPath(). Whole thing would need to use pointers - 
No, I think we just need a pointers version of Walk_iterator::GetPath(),
I think the poointers can be got via eg &*iterator, and the off by one
needs sorting (include root, exclude whatever's on the leaves - but 
check current behaviour).
	
	TransformOfAgent

Is output of a transformation (input tree nodes crossed with transformations)
	
	PointerIsAgent
	
Architype is created locally (but 1:1 with input tree nodes)(no, better 
than that, there is only one architype for each node TYPE).
	
	NestedAgent (depth)

Depth is constructed (input tree nodes crossed with subclasses)
