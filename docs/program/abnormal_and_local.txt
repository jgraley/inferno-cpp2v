		Abnormal Contexts:
		------------------

	NotMatchAgent
	MatchAnyAgent

And-rule does not apply (evaluator context)
Permitted non-match means maybe cannot key

	SearchContainerAgent (recurse restriction)		
	StarAgent

Reuse of agent confuses conjecture (multiuse context)	


		Local links:
		------------

	NormalAgent (subcontainers)
	StarAgent
	
Subcontainer is constructed - even though it could be refs...?	
 - TODO maybe merge star algo back in to NA (maybe absorb stars into 
   NAs in a pre-pass).
	
	SearchContainerAgent (recurse restriction)
	
Comes from Walk_iterator::GetPath(). Whole thing would need to use refs.
	
	TransformOfAgent

Is output of a transformation (input tree nodes crossed with transformations)
	
	PointerIsAgent
	
Architype is created locally (but 1:1 with input tree nodes)

	NestedAgent (terminus)
	
Need Advance() etc to work with refs; not difficult TODO
	
	NestedAgent (depth)

Depth is constructed (input tree nodes crossed with subclasses)
