		Abnormal Contexts:
		------------------

	NotMatchAgent

And-rule does not apply (evaluator context)
Negation means certainly cannot key

	MatchAnyAgent

And-rule does not apply (evaluator context)
Permitted non-match means maybe cannot key
 - unless key to non-matching leg just does not restrict?

	SearchContainerAgent (recurse restriction)

Reuse of agent confuses conjecture (multiuse context)	
	
	PointerIsAgent
	
Not sure TODO
	
	StarAgent

		Local links:
		------------

	NormalAgent (subcontainers)
	
Subcontainer is constructed - even though it could be refs...?	
	
	SearchContainerAgent (recurse restriction)
	
Comes from Walk_iterator::GetPath(). Whole thing would need to use refs.
	
	TransformOfAgent

Is output of a transformation (input tree nodes crossed with transformations)
	
	PointerIsAgent
	
Architype is created locally (but 1:1 with input tree nodes)
	
	StarAgent

Subcontainer is constructed - even though it could be refs...?	
 - just like NormalAgent subcontainers TODO should merge star 
   algo back in (maybe absorb stars into NAs in a pre-pass).

	NestedAgent (terminus)
	
Need Advance() etc to work with refs; not difficult TODO
	
	NestedAgent (depth)

Depth is constructed (input tree nodes crossed with subclasses)
