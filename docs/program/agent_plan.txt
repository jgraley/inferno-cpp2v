Detailed plan for refactoring into agent patterns

---NOTE: all steps here to be applied equalliy to search as well as replace---
1. all patterns wrapped by NormalAgentWrapper (except slaves, which jump ahead to 4)
2. initial invocation via agent interface 
3. all invocations via agent interface
4. all special patterns to derive from NormalAgent
5. pattern parameter (to BuildReplace) to be deduced from "this" locally, not passed in
6. Special node functions in NormalNode to be moved into the special nodes themselves (and just derive from Agent)
7. keynodes to be remmebered by agents, not passed in or looked up in central coupling keys object
8. Central couplingkeys object to be pensioned off
9. Call Confiugre on all agents centrally via a walk
10. Try to minimise depednecy on SearchReplace back pointer (sr)
