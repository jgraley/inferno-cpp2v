Simply build systemc-3.1.0 per the instructions in the zip file or tar-ball. You don't need to do
a system install, just do the default `make install` which installs into the unzipped
systemc-3.1.0 directory. Then, just make a symlink to that dir from the inferno repo root called 
just `systemc`.

Notes:
 - The test scripts use LD_LIBRARY_PATH to allow test executables to get the SystemC stuff.
 - SystemC wants C++17 (although inferno/VN is now on C++20)
