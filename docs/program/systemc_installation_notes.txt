# What I had to do to install systemc-2.2.0.tgz on Ubuntu 10.10 using bash and gcc 4.4.5, 4.7.? and 4.8.5. Best
# done by hand, and read the INSTALL guide that comes with SystemC
# Got from http://www.accellera.org/downloads/standards/systemc/files (2007 version of SystemC 2.2)
#
# Note: the accelera link given above has stopped working, so now we include the tarball in 
# our repo, but patches still have to be applied manually.
#
tar -zxf systemc-2.2.0.tgz
cd systemc-2.2.0

mkdir objdir
cd objdir

export CXX=g++
export LIBS=-lpthread # added to get -lpthread on the link line of the examples
../configure

gedit ../src/sysc/utils/sc_utils_ids.cpp
# in gedit, insert the following lines at the top of the file:
#include <string.h>
#include <cstdlib>

make debug # insns say gmake, but not available on ubuntu
# observe lots of warnings scrolling by
------------------
Additional note: repeating this with GCC4.7 onward, I needed to remove four (presumably 
incorrect) "mutable" keywords at reference decls, as requested by the compiler.
------------------
Further: on going to gcc 9.4, I also needed to fix up default values in args of
friend declarations: defaults should be moved to the original declaration.
------------------

make install

make check # you should to do this check whether systemc can link
# have to press return once
------------------
Additional note: you may have to comment out a using std::gets; - the check still 
completes after doing this.
------------------

# For inferno to use SystemC, create a symbolic link inferno-cpp2v-code/systemc pointing to the
# systemc directory, systemc-2.2.0 in this case.

# To compile, use eg
g++ my_prog.cpp -Iresource/include -Isystemc/include -Lsystemc/lib-linux64/ -lsystemc
# Note that this makes inferno include files available too
