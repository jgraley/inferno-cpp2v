Local instance of CompareReplace
--------------------------------

- Stuff node
search_container_agent.cpp:44
Any can_key
Configures the local CR with restrict_pattern and sets master coupling keys, then
passes into Walk to get the search container.
? Try to make a local filter for the walk so we can get hands on the actual compare call


Use of CompareReplace::Compare()
--------------------------------

- Slave node
slave_agent.cpp:50
Bona fide - this one really does want to recurse into a new engine instance!


Use of Agent::Compare()
-----------------------

- Star agent
star_agent.cpp:32
Only when can_key==false
Repeated calls over a specified range (candidate match for Star)

- Soft agent
soft_agent.cpp:76
Used to implement AbnormalCompare()
? Try only on can_key==false, while returning true otherwise DONE;WORKS!


AbnormalCompare() 
-----------------
Note: all are any can_key - soft patterns not even told!

- NotMatch node
soft_patterns.hpp:26
Only when can_key==false (still needed due to the inversion)
Comments about an abnormal context, which is correct

- MatchAny
soft_patterns.hpp:163
Used here due abnormal context (some children need not match)

- MatchOdd
soft_patterns.hpp:192
Used here due abnormal context (some children need not match)

- PointerIs
soft_patterns.hpp:264
Used here because cannot figure out how to do coupling and no use case needs it.
