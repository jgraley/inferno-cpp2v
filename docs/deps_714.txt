A dependency analysis based on rev 714, done by eye using grep so could be innaccuracies. Directories are treasted as units except helpers, which is broken up into S&R, a few individual source files and other-helpers which is what is left. The aim is to make S&R and other-helpers mutually un-dependent, and to move the singly-named files into the approriate groups. * indicates a problematic dependency. A new dir hierarchy will result.
