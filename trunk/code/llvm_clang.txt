
Building LLVM/Clang

LLVM directory hierarchy should be rooted in same directory as inferno-synth so you can have
> ls
inferno-synth/
llvm-x.y/

Clang directory hierarchy should be rooted in llvm-x.y/tools/ so you can have eg llvm-x.y/tools/clang/lib/... etc

Apply patches as per my latest diffs for LLVM and Clang. Note that some libraries are removed from the makefiles
in clang/lib and llvm-x.y/lib. These are not needed and didn't seem to compile. Also note #includes of 
llvm_inferno_include.h
from various places in llvm and clang.

From llvm-x.y/lib and llvm-x.y/tools/clang/lib, type

make ENABLE_OPTIMISED=0
