Verilog funcitons and tasks
---------------------------

Verilog functions are limited in that: 
 - they must return a value
 - they must take >= 1 parameter
 - they may not take output or input parameters
 
Tasks remove these limits, but a task may not be invoked by a function. In summary, despite the obvious attraction of functions when converting from C, we choose not to use these constructs. C functions actually map onto modules that contain one or more procedural blocks to implement the algorithm.
