Steps that deal with intra-object code, including stating-out and recursion


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add poll loops

Replace all wait() calls with a poll loop that checks the condition repeatedly.
Insert a minor delay into the loop in order to explicitly spread it out over
time. This is really associated with "add clock/reset" but we do it up here 
so we can state-out the loop.

Invariant: our reliance on SystemC eventing is hidden and the need for poll
loops made explicit.

Note: we may not need this if using asynchronous technology. State-out should be
able to still work if we skip this step leaving wait(x) in place of delay()
loops.

Example output:

void f()
{
   // x is some event or group of events
   while(!x) delay(); // used to be wait(x)
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Merge member functions

Merge all the member functions in a server into a single one that uses a big
switch statement to select the implementation based on a new enum parameter.
Parameters of the original functions should be grouped into a struct for each of
the original member functions then unioned together for the big function. Return
value should be handled similarly.

Invariant: all calls are simple recursions on the big function (apart from
SystemC primatives) since there's nothing else to call.

Note: this single function is now the server's run (process) function. Since
SystemC expects the run function to be void(void) we will have to add a
primative to forward the call. The "which" enum value supplied should be 0 for
the run function; this thunk can be removed after flattening recursion.

Note: originally was before memberise locals, but that proved impossible due to
pointer lowering steps. This must be done after structural steps to ensure we
keep separate call interfaces for separate call sites (1:1 wiring).

Note: also merge the explicit stacks for the functions @todo maybe more
efficient not to; but we need somewhere to put the stacked state. 

@todo Need to stack the new locals added here 

Example output (intial functions were char f(char) and int g(int, int)):

struct g_params { int p1, int p2 };

union big_params { char f, g_params g };
union big_result { int f, char g };

enum which { F, G };

big_result big_function( which w, big_params bp )
{
    big_result br;
    switch( which )
    {
        case F:
            param = bp.f;
            ...algorithm from f...
            br.f = return_value;
            break;
            
        case G:
            param_1 = bp.g.p1;
            param_2 = bp.g.p2;
            ...algorithm from f...
            br.g = return_value;
            break;                                    
    }
    return br;
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lower constructs

Lower constructs that are not supported in combable (synthesisable) Verilog into
conditional branches ie if(cond) goto label; Also force a state transition for
each delay(). 

Lower the following in all cases:
    for - lower into a while loop (@todo should this be a seperate step?)
         while - test at start and jump out if fail; jump back to start at the
end. Break jumps out; continue jumps to test.
    do-while - test at end and jump back to start if pass. Break as   
               per while() @todo what does continue do in a do-while. I      
should know. I don't.
    delay() - add a trivial "goto here" and label, but keep the delay() call.
    
    
Lower if a label is contained within the construct (after the above lowering):
    if - test and jump past "then" blocvk if fail; end of "then" block jumps   
         past "else" block.
    switch - build a lookup table of case values to real labels (enumerated).
             Generate the "goto x" primative. Break jumps out.
       
Invariant: all constructs combable or can be trivially stated-out

Note: there's some flexibility here in how much stuff we lower. It corresponds
to design tradeoffs in the final hardware. Any construct surrounding a label
must itself be lowered. 

Note: Ifs etc could be partially stated if for example the "then" block
contains a label but the "else" block does not. Likewise switch statements.
    
Note: the "goto x" primative is needed when lowering recursion in order to jump
back to the correct state when returning - ensure same primative is used.

Note: switch statements may be optimised by choosing the enum values for states
to match the suer-supplied case values, or by making the mapping simple (eg
prepend a bit pattern). Since multiple switch statements will tend to overload
the space, the optimisation should be performed after this step. This will help
allow a manually written state amchine in the input program to be preserved as
such.

Note: Retain local scope structure for now. @todo check whether we will break
goto/scope rules here.

@todo early returns

Example, lowering for( x, y, z ) {...} 

{ 
    x; 
    while( y ) 
    { 
        {...} 
        z; 
    } 
}

Example, lowering while(x) {...}

{
    CONTINUE:
    if( !x ) goto BREAK;
    {...} // break becomes goto BREAK, continue becomes goto CONTINUE
    goto CONTINUE;
    BREAK: 
}
       
Example, lowering do {...} while(x)

{
    DO:
    {...} // break becomes goto BREAK, dunno about continue
    if( x ) goto DO;
    BREAK: 
}
       
Example, lowering delay()

{
    delay();
    goto DELAY; // create a state change. 
    // Maybe put a barrier here to stop this construct getting optimised away.
    DELAY:
}
       
Example, fully lowering if(x) {...} else {,,,}

{
    if( !x ) goto ELSE;
    {...}
    goto ENDIF;
    ELSE:
    {,,,}
    ENDIF:
}

Example, fully lowering switch(x) { case 1: ...; case 2: ,,,; }    

{
    Label y = primative_lookup(x); // @todo what, exactly do we want here?
    goto y; // goto-a-variable primative (will optimise out later)
    CASE_1:
    ...; // break becomes goto BREAK;
    CASE_2:
    ,,,; 
    BREAK:    
}


----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Add state variable

Add an enum with a value for each label, add a local variable of that type
called state and maintain it correctly by assigning to it immediately before
each goto. Initialise to eg INIT_STATE at start of the function (regardless of
recursion depth).

Note: assert this at each label as a double check since we have a little
redundancy at this point. Treat assert as a primative (and use the "standard"
kind of assert as in assert.h).

Note: the state variable should be inserted into the local variables data
structure so that it gets stacked when the function recurses.

Example output:

void f()
{
    // initialising the state
    locals[stack_pointer].state = INIT_STATE;

    
    // if( x ) goto FOO; becomes...
    if( x ) { locals[stack_pointer].state = STATE_FOO; goto FOO; }
    
    ...
    
    // FOO: becomes...
    FOO:
    assert( locals[stack_pointer].state==STATE_FOO );
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove scopes

Scoped blocks (surrounded by {}) should now be completely redundant. Get rid of
them.

Note: was part of memberise locals, but that got moved up into the data phase.

@todo we can't remove all scopes - we want to keep scopes on constructs that have not been lowered (because they will be combed-out by Verilog) and indeed the "else clauses" step actually adds scopes. So need a criterion for deciding which scopes to remove. Maybe the invariant should be no scopes around labels?

Invariant: No scopes (apart from overall function scope)

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lower recursion

Turn each recursion call point into a goto to the start of the function and at
the very end of the function insert a goto to the label implied by the state
variable. Add a new primitive for this.
 
Invariant: no recursion; no non-trivial function calls 

Note: the "goto a variable" primitive would have to become eg a switch statement
for the purposes of testing this step. It vanishes in the "State-out" step.

Note: every LABEL: must have an assert( state==LABEL_STATE ); otherwise
state-out won't work. This is why we have to duplicate the sp++ and state=INIT
for each fn call. But we're close enough to Verilog that synth tools should be
able to help ;-)

@todo deal with params/return value

Note: at the end of this stage, the only caller to the function will be to start
the process - so can fold in the thunk we added in at function merge.

Example output:

void f()
{
    locals[stack_pointer].state = INIT_STATE; // from add state variable step
    INIT_STATE: // new
    assert( state==AFTER_RECURSION_STATE );

    ...
    
    // used to be f();
    locals[stack_pointer].state = AFTER_RECURSION;
    stack_pointer++;
    locals[stack_pointer].state = INIT_STATE; 

    AFTER_RECURSION:
    assert( state==AFTER_RECURSION_STATE )
    
    ...
    
    // end of function
    stack_pointer--;
    goto locals[stack_pointer].state;
}    

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Else clauses for skipped code

Place code after a conditional goto (a goto in an if) up to the next label into
an else clause if it isn't already in one. If there is code between an
unconditional goto and the next label, it is an error (the code is unreachable). In general, there may be more than one goto in between each consecutive pair of labels and these gotos may be combed out so that there is a state for each label. This could be regarded as an optimisation (compared to adding a state for each goto), but we include it because it permits the result of state-out to resemble what one would expect from the lower-constructs step.

The idea is to ensure that there is no code in an executable path between a goto and the next label.

Invariant: gotos do not need to be enacted until the next label is reached

Note: at the start of this step, there should be 0 or more if(something) goto SOMEWHERE; and then one unconditional goto SOMEWHERE_ELSE; just before the label. If this is not true, it is an error.

Example:

LABEL1:
if(x) { state = X; goto X; }
...
if(y) { state = Y; goto Y; }
,,,
{ state = Z; goto Z; }
LABEL2:

becomes:

LABEL1:
if(x) { state = X; goto X; }
else
{
    ...
    if(y) { state = Y; goto Y; }
    else
    {
        ,,,
        { state = Z; goto Z; }
    }
}
LABEL2:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
State-out

Surround the entire function with a switch statement on the state variable.
Generate a case for each label ending just before the next label. Insert a break
at the end of each case. Remove the gotos, leaving only the assignments to the
state variable. 

Invariant: context is released between each combable block

Note: we are taking advantage of the fact that SC_THREAD loops infinitely 

Example:

void f()
{
    LABEL1:
    ...
    { state = LABEL3; goto LABEL3; }
    LABEL2:
    if( x )
        { state = LABEL1; goto LABEL1; }
    else
    {
        ,,,
        { state = LABEL3; goto LABEL3; }
    }
    LABEL3:
    '''
    { state = LABEL2; goto LABEL2; }
}

becomes:

void f()
{
    switch( state )
    {
    case LABEL1:
        ...
        state = LABEL3;
        break;
    
    case LABEL2:
        if( x )
            state = LABEL1;
        else
        {  
            ,,,
            state = LABEL3;
        } 
        break;
    
    case LABEL3:
        '''
        state = LABEL2;
        break;
    }
    // When switch falls out we exit the function, but funciton is a SC_THREAD
    // and SC will just call it again in an infinite loop.
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extract waits

Replace all delay() calls with a single one at the bottom of the function. We now have a minor delay for all the minor delays that were explicitly requested, and also for each state transition. This is the step that establishes the states as being spread out over time, in the manner of a computer.

Invariant: no non-trivial context across a delay()

Note: this is possible because all the delay() calls are at the ends of state
cases and there's now nothing after them until you get to the bottom of the
function.

Example output:

void f()
{
    switch( state )
    {
       ...blah blah, but we've removed all the delay() calls
    }
    delay();
}

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Insert clock and reset

Move all servers to SC_CTHREAD. Replace the delay() at the bottom with 
wait(clk). @todo or whatever you do in an SC_CTHREAD to await a clock pulse.

This step is simply a clarification of the fact that we will generate a clocked architecture, and not eg an asynchronous design. We are implementing the minor delay as a period of time equal to 1/Fc. This step also implies the existance of clock signal routing.

Invariant: no more delay() primitive - all events explicitly controlled 
by clock

@todo not sure about clock distribution or how to handle reset. Maybe reset 
should zero all stored data as a first step in startup. @todo

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Remove server context

Move to SC_METHOD. Remove the wait(clk) primitive. This step is simply a result of the fact that we are able to use SystemC's process model that invokes functionality once per clock instead of on a continuous basis. The underlying condition for this to be possible is that the only wait(clk) is in a trivial position - just before returning. Since funciton return and delay are together, the implicaiton is that we do not need to keep any execution context across a wait(clk). We can therefore release the context after each combable (=nominally instantaneous) bit of work. Consequently, we don't need our own context any more, we can just borrow some common shared context. 

The test rendering from this step will therefore not be multi-threeaded.

Invariant: no persistent implicit context

Note: this is really a pattern reduction: SC_CTHREAD{ ...; wait(); } becomes
SC_METHOD{ ...; }. If any functions don't match the pattern we have an error.
