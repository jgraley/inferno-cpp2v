design/steps/

This directory contains detailed designs for the actual steps that the convertor
will go through. The layout may vary, but basically each step is covered
separately and invariants, ordering limitations etc are discussed.

phases.txt provides a high-level overview of the entire transformation process.
Files named x_phase.txt describe phase x; the documents begin with an overview that
introduces the phase, and then lists the detailed steps.

docs/program/

This directory contains designs/documentation for the Inferno program itself not including the transformation steps themselves. This includes search and replace, interfaces, program layout, common ultilities etc.
