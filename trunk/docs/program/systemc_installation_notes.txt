# done by hand, and read the INSTALL guide that comes with SystemC

gunzip systemc-2.2.05jun06.tgz
tar -xf systemc-2.2.05jun06.tar
cd systemc-2.2.05jun06_beta
mkdir objdir
cd objdir
export CXX=g++
export CXX=-lpthread # added to get -lpthread on the link line of the examples
../configure
gedit ../src/sysc/utils/sc_utils_ids.cpp
# in gedit, insert the following lines at the top of the file:
# #include <string.h>
# #include <cstdlib>
make debug # insns say gmake, but not available on ubuntu
# observe lots of warnings scrolling by
make install
make check # need to do this otherwise you won't know whether systemc can link
