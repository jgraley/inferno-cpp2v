# What I had to do to install systemc-2.2.0.tgz on Ubuntu 10.10 using bash and gcc 4.4.5. Best
# done by hand, and read the INSTALL guide that comes with SystemC

tar -zxf systemc-2.2.0.tgz
cd systemc-2.2.0

mkdir objdir
cd objdir

export CXX=g++
export LIBS=-lpthread # added to get -lpthread on the link line of the examples
../configure

gedit ../src/sysc/utils/sc_utils_ids.cpp
# in gedit, insert the following lines at the top of the file:
#include <string.h>
#include <cstdlib>

make debug # insns say gmake, but not available on ubuntu
# observe lots of warnings scrolling by

make install

make check # you should to do this check whether systemc can link
# have to press return once

------------------

# For inferno to use SystemC, create a symbolic link inferno-cpp2v/trunk/systemc pointing to the
# systemc directory, systemc-2.2.0 in this case.

# To compile, use eg
g++ my_prog.cpp -Iresource/include -Isystemc/include -Lsystemc/lib-linux64/ -lsystemc
# Note that this makes inferno include files available too
