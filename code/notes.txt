
Building LLVM/Clang
-------------------

LLVM directory hierarchy should be rooted in same directory as inferno-synth so you can have
> ls
inferno-synth/
llvm-x.y/

Clang directory hierarchy should be rooted in llvm-x.y/tools/ so you can have eg llvm-x.y/tools/clang/lib/... etc

Apply patches as per my latest diffs for LLVM and Clang. Note that some libraries are removed from the makefiles
in clang/lib and llvm-x.y/lib. These are not needed and didn't seem to compile. Also note #includes of 
llvm_inferno_include.h
from various places in llvm and clang.

From llvm-x.y/lib and llvm-x.y/tools/clang/lib, type

make ENABLE_OPTIMIZED=0

or use the "llvm" and "clang" targets in the inferno makefile in inferno-synth/trunk/code (but these 
go to wrong directory: "lib" missing

archives: llvm-2.3/Debug/lib
objects: in Debug/ dir among sources


Other issues
------------

CygWin problems running svn on command line
Symptom: gives "app failed" dialogs on Vista, apparently silent fail on XP
Reason: svn depends on libaprutil, which depends on libexpat0. But the latter dependency is missing
Fix: install libexpat0 using cygwin tool ("libexpat0" under "libs")
