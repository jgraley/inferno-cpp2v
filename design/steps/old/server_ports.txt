Server port interface
=====================

The ports on a server module fall into three categories:

1. Clock/reset lines
2. Server (call-in) interface(s)
3. Client (call-out) interface(s)

They appear in the above order in the module's port list. This document does not descibe the clock/reset lines because they depend on the clock/reset policy which is doumented elsewhere.

We first describe the ports required for a given call interface for both server and client (since they are mirror images of each other) and then the rule for determining which call interfaces to include.
