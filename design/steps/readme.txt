design/steps

This directory contains detailed designs for the actual steps that the convertor will go through. The layout may vary, but basically each step is covered separately and invariants, ordering limitations etc are discussed.

philosophy.txt is a good starting point for a slightly sketchy overview. It lists a number of more specific documents at the end. 

steps.txt presently holds all the steps - when this gets too big they'll be seperated out.
